Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language that emphasizes code readability and simplicity. 
Created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991, Python has grown to become one of the most popular 
languages in the world. Its syntax allows developers to express concepts in fewer lines of code than would be 
possible in languages such as C++ or Java zaryab. Python supports multiple programming paradigms, including procedural, 
object-oriented, and functional programming. Thanks to its large standard library and the availability of third-party 
modules, Python can be used for web development, data analysis, artificial intelligence, automation, scientific computing, 
and more. Python's vibrant community continuously contributes to its improvement and ensures that it remains at the 
forefront of modern programming practices.
